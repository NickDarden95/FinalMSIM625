The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplane’s braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab’s design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration’s lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers’ inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer’s limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir’s failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir’s route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.","Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Scheduled/routine maintenance - Other, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Main landing gear - Incorrect service/maintenance, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - (general) - Attain/maintain not possible, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Decision making/judgment - Pilot, Environmental issues - Conditions/weather/phenomena - Wind - Tailwind - Decision related to condition, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Equipment design - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Land gear sys wiring - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - (general) - Operator, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Environmental issues - Operating environment - Airport facilities/design - (general) - Decision related to condition",,"53.898333999999998","-166.54417000000001","Saab","2000","AIR","PADU","Unalaska","false","2","TP","SCHD",,"121","Substantial","VMC","Peninsula AviationServices Inc.,","Landing","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100437","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA20MA002.aspx"

The liner buckling resulted in airflow disruption and reduced engine performance. The engine fuel control unit attempted to compensate for the decrease in engine performance by increasing the fuel flow rate. The combustion liner damage and increased fuel flow led to incomplete combustion of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber. Unconsumed fuel then ignited downstream of the combustion chamber (delayed ignition) and resulted in high pressure turbine thermal damage, and the eventual separation of a high pressure turbine 2nd stage nozzle vane segment. The separated vane segment subsequently caused low pressure turbine case burn through and catastrophic impact damage to the high and low pressure turbine stages.","Aircraft - Aircraft power plant - Engine (turbine/turboprop) - Combustion section - Fatigue/wear/corrosion",,"41.990276000000001","-87.904724000000002","BOMBARDIER INC","CL 600 2C10","AIR","ORD","Chicago O'Hare Intl","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Minor","Unknown","SKYWEST AIRLINES INC","Takeoff","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=95345","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/95345/pdf"

The fuel imbalance was due to incomplete refueling and an ineffective preflight inspection by the pilot.  The imbalance was further complicated by an incorrectly assembled fuel transfer valve and motor combination.  

Contributing to the severity of the accident was the pilot's delayed decision to eject prior to exceeding the ejection seat envelope.  Also contributing to the accident was (1) the Navy's oversight environment, which did not require airman, aircraft, and risk management controls or standards expected of a commercial civil aviation operation, and (2) ATAC's organizational environment, which did not include CRM training to promote good aeronautical decision-making and ORM guidance to mitigate hazards.  Also contributing to the accident were the design features of the airplane, which were typical of its generation, including the lack of accurate fuel quantity indications, the design of the fuel transfer valve; and the maintenance program's lack of clearly documented procedures and type-specific training for the Hunter.","Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Decision making/judgment - Pilot, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - Lateral/bank control - Attain/maintain not possible, Aircraft - Fluids/misc hardware - Fluids - Fuel - Fluid management, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Incomplete action - Ground crew, Personnel issues - Task performance - Inspection - Preflight inspection - Pilot, Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Repair - Maintenance personnel, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Identification/recognition - Pilot, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Equipment/furnishings - Emergency equipment - Not used/operated, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Organizational issues - Management - Culture - Standard operating practices - Operator, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Fuel system - (general) - Design",,"34.118887999999998","-119.118888","HAWKER AIRCRAFT LTD","HAWKER HUNTER MK.58A","AIR","KNTD","Naval Air Station Point Mugu","false","1","TJ",,"PUBF","PUBU","Destroyed","VMC","ATAC","Approach","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=83685","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/83685/pdf"

The loose connection resulted from a missing lock washer that allowed the resistance in the electrical path to increase sufficiently to generate high enough temperatures to ignite the terminal block.

Contributing to the probable cause was the lack of instructions to ensure the lock washer was installed in the J5 power terminal block in the Boeing 757 aircraft maintenance manual (AMM). 

Additionally, contributing to the incident was the deferral of the related maintenance write-up before the incident, which resulted from information in the United Airlines AMM that stated, “When bus bar(s) show signs of blackening or burning, the condition is acceptable for continued service, although the window must be replaced within 50 flight-hours.","Aircraft - Aircraft structures - Windows-windshield system - Flight compartment windows - Incorrect service/maintenance, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - Maintenance provider, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Oxygen system - Crew oxygen system - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - Adequacy of policy/proc - FAA/Regulator",,"38.900084999999997","-77.449477999999999","BOEING","757","AIR","IAD","Washington Dulles","false","2","TF","SCHD",,"121","Minor",,,"Enroute","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=76023","https://data.ntsb.gov/carol-repgen/api/Aviation/ReportMain/GenerateNewestReport/76023/pdf"

Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties.  Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots.
